  { href: '/', text: 'Going Medieval is an impressive colony-building sim, with lots of potential and a little room for improvement. Even in its current Early Access state, it is tons of fun, with high replayability due to its in-depth customization. You can make it as difficult as possible with a variety of options to choose from and just sit back and build huge settlements if thats your forte, or you could start in the dead of winter, with one villager, and brutal raids every night. Going Medieval is extremely ambitious, with many interesting systems to sink your teeth into, and a delightful world out there to explore. If only theyd let us go just a bit farther one day.', reviewer: '- GameSpace.' ,link:'https://www.gamespace.com/featured/going-medieval-early-access-review/'},
  { href: '/', text: 'But the game is early access, of course, and is sold at a very reasonable price for what is currently in the game. The developers have an impressively comprehensive roadmap of what they intend to add to the game over time, and if those plans are all fulfilled, Going Medieval has the potential to become an incredibly detailed and nuanced colony sim that one could easily sink dozens of hours into happily. As it stands now, it is a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out for any fans of the genre or fans who want a good introduction to the colony sim genre. Either way, Going Medieval is a game to keep an eye on.
